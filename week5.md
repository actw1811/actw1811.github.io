During this week of research, We were given an simple one nostril model and it was our job to make a simulation with it by ourselfs to show what My groupmates and I have learned about comsol. I personally killed it and was very exicted for more but i have to help my groupmates catch up to my understanding of comsol in this stage of the project. My challenges was all about avioding some tissues that will be in the way of the target zone for the particles in question. I tried alot of different things like changing the cone angle to refined numbers like pi/30 for thinner lines but i figured out, it may ahve been the angle of the axis instead although it didn't solve my problem completely. Im heading in the right direction to tackle this head on.
