During this week of research, we starting thinking of how we were going to read the paper and the presentation that will be due next week. Other then that the week was pretty slow. We made 64 simpiflied models with different parameters in The radius and depth of tissues blocking the passage from being a straight shot and the thickness of the air passage. Multitasking how to make export data from comsol right and all the writing, we need done. One problem that was common this week was the mesh of the models were failing to produce sometimes with no way to fix them.
