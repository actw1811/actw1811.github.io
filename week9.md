During this week of research, We has a very hard time optimizing the data, we been gathering for 1 week into understandable data for a code given to us by own mentor. The most challenging task, this week was staying focus. I was feeling very gloomy and rainy this week, causing me to lose focus sometimes. AFter the trials and errors of data managing, we succuessed in making 64 working datasets to use in our results. Some errors were, the file was too large due to info we didn't need clogging us up. The time inverval were way to large too making clutter and finally the release pount for all of them wasn't angle right with the thickness of the air passage in mind.
