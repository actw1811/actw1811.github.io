During this week of research, This week zoomed by and we was about to get a bit of work done. It would have been more but we ran into a hill setting up for data generation tables in comsol. After changing things to make that possible, the simulation would no longer compute as fast as it was. Now about this weeks presentations, i feel like My team and I killed it. I tried to be engaging and thanks to all that ones who clapped and asked some nice questions. We did a lot of preparing on monday and thursday.
