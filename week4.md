During this week of research, My mentor was teaching us how to use COMSOL for modeling and testing the fluid flow of a cylinder like shape. we did this in 2D and 3D to get a feel of the software. I feel like i have a basic understanding of the application after messing around with it all week. On thursday, I was also shown an application called MeshMixer. I didn't relly have any problems this week, it was all just a learning experience and im little exicted to see what comes nexts.
