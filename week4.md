During this week of research, My Mentor gave me the patient specific ear models for testing anf getting familiar with the parameters such as the angles for the starting point where the particles start from and the target point where the particles must end for the most effective distribution of the particles to the target point. I felt like i accomplished and learned a lot this week. Im starting to really get the hang of the application we are using to show our progress and understanding of this project but best of all im having lots of fun.
