During the first week, I met with Dr. Zheng Li and my mentor Guiliang Liu to discuss the project "Reduced order model development with machine learning to simulate drug delivery in nasal cavity". He explained and mapped out, what our progrssive would look like from 6/3 to the end of the program. The other parts of the week were some helpful to make my life a bit easier. I didn't know much about machine learning besides the little things i was told in my data structures class when i was a sophomore. I did have much of a problem with anything we were being shown, i did take it all in though. A big finding i made was machine learning code is wayyyyyy easier than i expected. I can't forget the review on numpy and pandas, i haven't taken since the beginning of my sophomore year.
