During this week of research, The final week of the program was so stressful because we had to gather out all the research. we did over this 10 week time period and make a great presentation. we had alot of last minute prroblems with the dataset but thanks to the tenacity of my groupmates and I, we get it done and ready to go. Thanks to all the amazing people that started and maintained the program, it was a great experience. 10/10
