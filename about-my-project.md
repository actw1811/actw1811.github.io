## About My Project

Reduced order model development with machine learning to simulate drug delivery in nasal cavity

Problem: Machines that simulate drugs to the nasal cavity can be pretty inaccurate in effectively getting the medince into the ear of the patient . 

Approach: During this project, we will be using models to test different parameters to increase fluid flow through the nose

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a conference poster presentation at the end of the Summer AI program. The poster will focus on our dicoveries with the model.
