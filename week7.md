During this week of research, We got some feedback on the quality of the research papers that we read related to our topic of "Reduced order model development with machine learning to simulate drug delivery in nasal cavity" We practied our Presentations a lot this week especially after the tech problems. the prepare time was definitely helpful. Other than that, i worked on optimizing my angles for my simulation with the axis and velocity in mind. Some challages were trurly understanding the signs of a good research paper looks like and how can we avoid the same mistakes. I was also very nervous for the presentations but was thankful for more time to get ready.
