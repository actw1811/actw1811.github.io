During this week of research, My mentor was teaching us how to use COMSOL for modeling and testing the fluid flow of a the nose itself but at a very basic level. The trip to Johns hopkins was great and super informative. I tried some basic parameter like the number of values and diameters of the particles plus the cone angle from the release point. At John hopkins, i seen some similarities to my project but with the world and weather predictions.
